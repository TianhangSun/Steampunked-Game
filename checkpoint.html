<p>Indicate how you will encode a  game in your database. </p>
<p>We have four tables, user, game, game pieces(tiles) and validator. The user table will represent user, the validator will represent the validator when user create their account, these are similar to step assignment so they're obvious. The game table manages games, each game will have one row in it, it has an unique id, the userid of the one who created it as well as an indicator of whose turn it is currently. The game pieces table represent tiles in the game, all we need to know in order to reconstruct the tiles are: orientation, tilename(type), and x/y location, also, we needs to know which game owns this tile.</p>
